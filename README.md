# Basic Understanding

JavaFX was integrated with 3D materials and meshes. A mesh is the physical shape of an object,
while the material represents the color or texture. 

## Small Ideas

In order to understand JavaFX, basic understanding of 3D space and data structures are needed. Important concepts:

**Graph:** A data structure that represents a visual tree. It is similar to a ancestry tree. 

**Node:** Each component of a tree. [All subclasses of the Scene class inherit from Node]

**Children:** A node that comes from an upper (parent) node.

**Meshes:** Any geometric shape that represents an entity.

**Materials:** A 2D image that is added to a mesh.
